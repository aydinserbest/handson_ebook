    First, you learned how to create and shut down WebDriver instances.
    These objects represent a browser controlled with Selenium WebDriver.
    This way, we use an instance of ChromeDriver for Chrome, FirefoxDriver for Firefox, etc.

    Second, you looked at WebElement, a class representing different web page elements
    (e.g., links, images, form fields, etc.). Selenium WebDriver provides several strategies to locate web elements:
    by HTML attribute (id, name, or class), tag name, link text (complete or partial),
    CSS selector,
    and XPath.
    We also looked at a brand-new strategy of Selenium WebDriver 4 called relative locators.

    Then, we covered user actionsâ€™ impersonation, using the keyboard and the mouse.
    You can use these actions from simple actions (e.g., clicking a link, filling a text input, etc.)
    to complex user gestures (e.g., drag and drop, click and hover, etc.).

    Finally, we examined the ability to wait in Selenium WebDriver tests.
    This feature is critical due to the current distributed, dynamic, and asynchronous nature of web applications.
    There are three main wait strategies in Selenium WebDriver:
    implicit (specify a general timeout to wait for elements), explicit (pause test execution until a given condition),
    and fluent (extension of an explicit wait with some fine-grained setup).
