    The standalone mode is actually not a part of Selenium Grid.
    It refers to a Selenium Server running independently, without being part of the Selenium Grid infrastructure.
    In this mode, you start the Selenium Server and send commands to browser sessions through the WebDriver interface.
    Both hub and node roles are served by a single machine in this setup.

    In Standalone Mode:

    The Selenium Server runs alone and serves as both hub and node.
    It controls browsers running on the local machine.
    It allows you to run your tests across different browsers and versions.
    You cannot run it across different operating systems since the Selenium Server operates on the local machine
    using the OS installed there.
    In Selenium Grid:

    Hub and nodes can run on separate machines or on the same machine as different processes.
    You can manage multiple nodes supporting different operating systems because each node can be a different machine
    or a virtual machine.
    The hub routes incoming test requests to the appropriate nodes, thus providing centralized management.
    Therefore, standalone mode is often preferred for quick testing during development or for working
    with a specific version of a browser. Grid, on the other hand, is used more for parallel testing
    across different browsers and operating systems and managing these tests from a central point.

    In light of these explanations, we can say that standalone mode can also offer
    some central management advantages within its scope; for example, controlling different browser versions
    from a single point. However, for cross-operating system tests, the Grid structure must be used.
    Even though local browsers are used in both cases,
    the centralized and scalable management provided by Grid is not possible in standalone mode.

    /*
    In Standalone mode,
    the Selenium Server runs on the local machine
    and therefore uses the operating system installed on the local machine.
    Consequently, you cannot run it on different operating systems.
    This is a limitation that applies specifically to local browser testing.

    However, when you want to manage tests that run on different operating systems
    using multiple machines or virtual machines,
    it may be more appropriate to use Selenium Grid.
    In this case, you can run Selenium Grid on multiple machines and coordinate tests
    on different operating systems and browser versions.
    For scenarios involving multiple machines, such as CI/CD pipelines or test environments,
    Selenium Grid is often more useful than Standalone mode.
    This is why I mentioned that Standalone mode is generally useful for such scenarios.
