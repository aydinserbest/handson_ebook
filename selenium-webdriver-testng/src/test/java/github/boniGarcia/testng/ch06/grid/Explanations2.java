    Hub and Node Structure: Selenium Grid has a structure of one "hub" (router) and several "nodes" (executors).
    The hub receives test commands and directs them to the appropriate nodes.
     */
    /*
    Different Browsers and Systems:
    Each node can be configured with different browsers and operating systems.
    This can include different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or operating systems
    like Windows, MacOS, Linux.


    The Grid server runs tests using browsers on the connected nodes.


    Cross-Browser Testing:
    Grid facilitates cross-browser testing, because you can use different browsers and versions
    on different nodes at the same time.//The terms "hub" and "node" are frequently used in Selenium Grid,
    and understanding these concepts is important to grasp how Selenium Grid works.

    Hub (Router):
    The hub is the central point of Selenium Grid. You send your tests here,
    and the hub directs these tests to the appropriate nodes.
    The hub is the brain of the Grid and controls all traffic.
    The machine running the hub is usually the central server used to manage and distribute tests.

    Node (Executor):
    The nodes are where the actual tests are run.
    They can have different browsers and operating systems.
    A node can be configured to run only one test at a time or multiple test sessions simultaneously.
    Nodes register with the hub and inform the hub which browsers and operating systems are available.

    Browsers in Node:
    Each node has one or more browsers installed where tests will be run.
    For example, a node might have different browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge installed.
    Different versions can also be installed, which is important for cross-browser testing.

    Node's Connection:
    A node can be connected to the hub over a network or the internet.
    A node doesn't need to be a physical machine; it can also run on a virtual machine or cloud service.
    When a node connects to the hub, it reports its browsers and capabilities to the hub.

    Let's go through a scenario:

    Let's say a friend in Paris is running a Selenium Grid hub.
    You are in Rome and want to run your tests on this Grid.
    When you run the test, your commands go from Rome to the hub in Paris.
    The hub checks the connected nodes and selects a suitable node to run your test.
    This node could be on your friend's computer or on another machine located elsewhere.
    On the selected node, if the browser you specified for your test (such as Chrome) is available,
    the hub directs the test to that node and your test is run in the Chrome browser on that node.
    In this process, the browser used to run your test is the one already installed on the selected node.
    If there are multiple nodes and each is equipped with different browsers, the hub selects the appropriate
    one and runs your tests in that browser. This distributed structure provides the flexibility to test
    multiple different browsers and operating systems at the same time.


    When you start Selenium Grid with the command java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar standalone,
    you are actually running both hub and node functions on a single machine. In this case,
    the machine you run the command on acts as both the hub and the node, which is referred to as "standalone" mode.
    Standalone mode is typically used for development or trial purposes because it allows you to simply run everything
    on a single machine.

    However, when you want to create an expanded test infrastructure, that is, to set up a more complex Grid configuration
    using multiple nodes, you need to start the hub and nodes separately.

    Starting the Hub: You use a special command to start the Selenium Grid hub on a separate server.
    This command is usually java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar hub. Thus, this machine is now responsible
    for directing tests to the appropriate nodes.

    Connecting the Nodes: Then, on each machine where you want to run tests on different browsers or systems,
    you start a node. The command used to start a node is usually
    java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar node -hub [HUB_URL], and this command connects the nodes to the hub.

    Node Registration:
    When you start the nodes, you specify the URL of the hub
    so that the nodes can automatically register with the hub. During the registration process,
    the browsers and other features on the node are reported to the hub.

    Running Tests: When you run a test, the hub receives the test and directs it to one of the registered nodes.
    If no nodes are registered or all nodes are busy, the test will not run or will be queued.

    In summary, in standalone mode, you are running both hub and node functions on a single machine.
    But for a wider Grid configuration,
    you need to start the hub and nodes separately and register the nodes with the hub.
    This configuration provides a scalable and flexible testing environment.


    One of the main benefits of Selenium Grid is the ability to run tests on different devices and browsers.
    This requires the use of multiple nodes within the Grid structure:

    Different Computers: Typically, you need different computers to set up multiple nodes.
    Each computer can be configured as a different node and can be equipped with different browsers or operating systems.
    This allows you to run your tests in a wide variety of environments.

    Node Configuration:
    When configuring each node, you determine which browsers and operating systems they will have.
    Nodes usually include multiple browsers with different versions.

    Node Connection:
    To connect each node to the hub, you run the Selenium Server on the node and specify the URL of the hub.
    In this way, the node reports itself and its capacity to the hub.

    Cross-Browser Testing:
    If you want to test on different browsers and operating systems,
    you will need to use multiple nodes, each with different characteristics.
    For example, one node might run Chrome and Firefox on Windows, while another node might run Safari and Chrome on MacOS.

    Your Own Computer:
    You can also use your own computer as a node. However, to fully benefit from the advantages of Selenium Grid,
    it is recommended to set up nodes on different devices and operating systems.

    With this configuration, Selenium Grid allows you to understand how your tests perform in different environments.
    For instance, you can see how a web application behaves on different browsers
    like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and on different operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux.
    This is especially valuable for applications that have multiple types of users.



    If you run both the hub and node as Selenium Grid on your computer, and run your tests on this node,
    then the tests will run on the browsers on your local machine. This situation is
    usually useful during development and debugging stages because you can quickly run tests and see the results.

    However, to truly see the benefits of Selenium Grid,
    you often want to run tests in multiple environments and different browsers. This requires:

    Different Devices:
    Running multiple nodes on different devices or virtual machines.
    Different Browsers and Operating Systems:
    Configuring each node with different browsers and/or operating systems.
    Network Access:
    Nodes must be able to access the hub over a network (either your local network or the internet).
    Simultaneous Tests:
    Running parallel tests and reducing the total test time.
    With this setup, when you send a test to the hub, the hub selects the appropriate node and runs the test on that node.
    This node could be a physical or virtual machine with a different browser or operating system.
    This verifies cross-browser compatibility and user experience on different devices.

    Running a hub and node on your own computer is more suitable for simple tests and quick trials,
    but you won't be able to take full advantage of Selenium Grid's capabilities
    for running tests in multiple environments and parallel testing.


    If someone has started a central hub and connected 5 separate computers to this hub as nodes,
    and each node has different browsers or operating systems, when you send your tests to this hub,
    you will see the benefits of the Grid. Here's what will happen in this situation:

    Cross-Browser Testing: You can run your tests on different browser versions on each node.
    Cross-Platform Testing: By running your tests on nodes with different operating systems,
    you can test the cross-platform compatibility of your application.
    Parallel Tests: By running your tests simultaneously on different nodes,
    you can significantly reduce the total test time.
    Efficient Use of Resources: By distributing tests, you can use the resources of multiple machines
    instead of exhausting the resources of a single machine.
    This configuration is often used for large and distributed test suites because it allows you
    to test quickly and effectively in multiple environments.
    Having such a cross-browser and cross-platform test infrastructure is vital to understanding
    how an application will perform under real-world conditions.///Let's illustrate how a large technology company
    like Google might set up a real-world Selenium Grid configuration with a concrete example:

    Hub Setup:
    Google first sets up one or more powerful servers for the Selenium Grid Hub.
    This hub is usually located on a reliable and highly accessible network.
    The hub's job is to direct incoming test requests to the appropriate nodes.

    Node Setup:
    Google sets up multiple Selenium Nodes on servers across its data centers worldwide.
    These nodes are equipped with different browsers and operating systems.
    For example, some servers may only have Linux and Chrome, others may have Windows and Internet Explorer,
    and yet others may have MacOS and Safari.

    Virtualization and Containerization:
    Large companies often set up nodes on virtual machines or containers (such as Docker) instead of physical machines.
    This makes management easier and optimizes resource usage. Virtual machines and containers
    can be easily replicated and scaled dynamically as needed.

    Cloud-Based Solutions:
    Companies like Google may prefer cloud-based solutions for speed and scalability.
    Services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure provide
    the necessary infrastructure for tests
    and eliminate the need for the company to set up physical servers in its own data centers.

    CI/CD Integration:
    Google can integrate Selenium Grid into its continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
    This ensures that tests are run automatically after every code commit.

    Test Distribution:
    Since Google serves customers worldwide, it can run its tests on nodes located in different geographic locations.
