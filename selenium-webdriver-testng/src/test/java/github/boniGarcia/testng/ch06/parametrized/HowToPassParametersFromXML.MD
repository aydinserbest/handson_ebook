let's explain how TestNG's @Parameters annotation works:

TestNG allows you to run your tests with different values by using parameters defined in an XML configuration file. 
This is particularly useful for data-driven testing. 
The @Parameters annotation helps you to specify how these parameters should be passed to your methods. 
Here's a detailed explanation of this process:

Defining Parameters in the XML File: 
The first step is defining parameters in your TestNG XML file. 
These parameters are specified using the <parameter> tag and each has a name and a value.

For example, in your XML file, you might define:

<parameter name="username" value="user"/>
<parameter name="password" value="pass"/>

Using the @Parameters Annotation: 
In your test class, you add the @Parameters annotation to the method that should receive the parameters. 
Inside this annotation, you list the names of the parameters as defined in the XML file, in an array format.

@Parameters({"username", "password"})
public void setupClass(String username, String password) {
    // ...
}

Passing Parameters to the Method: 
When TestNG is run, it passes the values of the parameters defined in the XML file to the method annotated with @Parameters 
as arguments. In this case, the username and password arguments of the setupClass method are 
assigned the corresponding values from the XML file.

This mechanism allows you to run the same test with different scenarios by using different parameter values 
defined in your XML file. It's particularly useful when you want to flexibly run tests with different user credentials, 
configuration settings, or test data.

This explanation summarizes the basic functionality of the @Parameters annotation and how to use it. 
This feature makes your tests more modular and reusable.
