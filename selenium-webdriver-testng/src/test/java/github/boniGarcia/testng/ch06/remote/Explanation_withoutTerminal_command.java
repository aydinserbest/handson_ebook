    /*
    This test class, RemoteChromeJunitTestWithJavaSetup, is designed
    to automate the process of starting a Selenium Grid in standalone mode without using terminal commands.
    It programmatically locates a free port on the local machine using Selenium WebDriver's PortProber class
    and then starts the Selenium Grid on that port.
    The Main.main() method from the Selenium package is called with arguments to launch the Grid in standalone mode.

    Once the Grid has started, the test class waits for ten seconds to ensure the Grid is
    ready before proceeding. To aid in manual testing and validation,
    it also automatically opens the default web browser at the Grid's URL
    using a system command executed via Java's Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method.

    The @Test annotated method, testRemote,
    then navigates to a specified web page and logs the title to confirm that the WebDriver is
    interacting with the browser session as expected. This method includes an intentional delay
    to allow observation of the browser session before it asserts the page title contains the expected text.

    After each test, the @After annotated tearDown method is called to cleanly exit the browser session
    and ensure no resources are left hanging, which is crucial for preventing port
    and resource conflicts in subsequent test runs. This setup exemplifies a basic
    but complete use case for integrating Selenium Grid into a continuous integration workflow
    or for local debugging purposes.
