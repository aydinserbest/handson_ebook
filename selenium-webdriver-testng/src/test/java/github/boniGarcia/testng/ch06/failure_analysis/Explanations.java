    TestNG provides several listeners out of the box.
    These listeners are classes that capture different events of the test lifecycle.
    For instance, the ITestResult listener allows you to monitor the status
    and result of a test. As FailureNGTest shows,
    we can easily use this listener to implement failure analysis in a Selenium WebDriver test.
