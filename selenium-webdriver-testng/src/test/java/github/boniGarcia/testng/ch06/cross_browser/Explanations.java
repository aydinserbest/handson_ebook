    Cross-Browser Testing Cross-browser testing is a kind of functional testing in which we verify that
    a web application works as expected using different types of web browsers.
    A possible way to implement cross-browser tests is through parameterized tests using the browser type
    (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) as the test parameter.
