    The comment "//We click on the left button to launch a JavaScript alert." is there
    to explain the purpose of the line driver.findElement(By.id("my-alert")).click();
    in the context of the test script. Let's break down what this means:

    JavaScript Alert:
    A JavaScript alert is a simple dialog box that appears on a web page,
    typically used for notifications, warnings, or to get a confirmation from the user.
    It's a feature provided by web browsers and is generated using JavaScript code.

    Purpose of the Button Click:
    In the given web page ("https://bonigarcia.dev/selenium-webdriver-java/dialog-boxes.html"),
    there's presumably a button with the ID "my-alert". When this button is clicked,
    it triggers a JavaScript function that creates and shows an alert dialog box.

    Why Mention "JavaScript Alert":
    The comment is there to clarify that the action of clicking the button is intended
    to produce a JavaScript alert. This is important
    because the subsequent steps in the test script are specifically designed to handle this alert (waiting for it, checking its text, and accepting it).

    Understanding the Context in Automated Testing:
    In automated testing, especially with web applications,
    it's crucial to understand the context and the effect of each action.
    The comment helps anyone reading the code to quickly grasp that the button click is not just any action
    but specifically triggers a JavaScript alert, which is the main focus of the test case.

    In summary, the comment is a way to describe the intention
    and expected outcome of the button click in the context of the automated test script,
    making it clear that the action leads to the appearance of a JavaScript alert dialog.
