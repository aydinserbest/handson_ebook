    /*

    The Selenium WebDriver API provides the interface Alert
    to manipulate JavaScript dialogs (i.e., alerts, confirms, and prompts).

    Alert
    To show a message and wait for the user to press the button OK (only choice in the dialog).
    For instance, the following code will open a dialog that displays “Hello world!”
    and waits for the user to press the OK button.

    alert("Hello world!");

    Confirm
    To show a dialog box with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel.
    For instance, the following code will open a dialog showing the message “Is this correct?”
    and prompting the user to click on OK or Cancel.
    let correct = confirm("Is this correct?");
    Prompt
    To show a dialog box with a text message, an input text field,
    and the buttons OK and Cancel. For example, the following code
    shows a pop-up displaying “Please enter your name,” a dialog box in which the user can type,
    and two buttons (OK and Cancel).
    let username = prompt("Please enter your name");
    In addition, CSS allows implementing another type of dialog box called modal window.
    This dialog disables the main window (but keeps it visible) while overlaying a child pop-up,
    typically showing a message and some buttons. You can find a sample page
    on the practice web page containing all these dialog boxes (alert, confirm, prompt, and modal).
