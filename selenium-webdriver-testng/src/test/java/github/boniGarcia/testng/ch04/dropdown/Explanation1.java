    In Selenium, there's a special class for interacting with dropdown menus created with the <select> tag,
    called Select.
    This class simplifies interactions with dropdown menus and allows you
    to make selections without the need for manual clicking,
    like a user would.
    Selenium WebDriver's functionality in this regard
    uses the underlying JavaScript or the browser's automatic interaction capabilities
    to simulate the clicks that a real user would perform.

    When you manually interact with a web page,
    if you come across a <select> element, you indeed need to click on the element
    to see the dropdown and select an option. However, with Selenium,
    such an interaction is not necessary because you can directly choose the desired <option> using the Select class.

    In the code snippets you provided, the Selenium test uses the Select class as follows:

    Select dropdown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("dropdown")));
    dropdown.selectByVisibleText("Option 1");

    This code selects an option based on the visible text ("Option 1") of the <select> element.
    During this process,
    Selenium automatically opens the dropdown menu
    and selects the option without the need for any clicking by the user.

    On the other hand, for custom dropdown menus that do not use a <select> tag:

    driver.findElement(By.id("dropdownButton")).click();

    This code performs a click action to open the dropdown menu.
    This is used when dealing with a customized dropdown menu
    where the Select class is not applicable. Subsequently,
    to select an item from the opened list, you must click on that specific item.

    The difference in Selenium between <select> elements and customized dropdown menus reflects
    the need to accommodate different HTML structures and interaction behaviors of web applications.
