    The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in software testing that applies
    the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) to improve test automation.
    Let's break down the author's statement to understand how POM relates to OOP
    and why it's beneficial for Selenium WebDriver tests.

    The Page Object Model (POM)
    Separation of Concerns:
    POM separates the UI handling logic (locating elements, interacting with elements)
    into separate classes called "page classes" or "page objects".
    Each page object class represents a specific page or a component of a web application.
    Encapsulation:
    Page objects encapsulate the details of the interaction with the UI of the web application.
    They expose methods for operations (like clicking a button, entering text)
    without revealing the internal details of how these operations are performed.

    Relation to Object-Oriented Paradigm
    Modeling Pages as Objects:
    In OOP, everything is modeled as an object with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).
    POM applies this by treating each web page as an object (page object),
    where the elements on the page are attributes,
    and interactions with these elements are methods.
    Reusability:
    Just like objects in OOP can be reused across different parts of a program,
    page objects can be reused across different tests.
    This reduces code duplication.
    Abstraction:
    OOP encourages abstraction - hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities.
    Page objects abstract the complexity of UI interactions,
    so tests can use these objects without knowing the underlying code.
    Maintainability:
    Changes to the UI only require updates to the page objects, not the tests themselves,
    which aligns with the OOP principle of making code easier to maintain.
    Use in Selenium WebDriver Tests
    Role in Testing:
    In the context of Selenium WebDriver,
    page objects are used to represent the pages that tests will interact with.
    The tests themselves focus on the test logic (like verifying outcomes, sequencing interactions)
    rather than the specifics of how to interact with the UI.
    Example:
    A test for logging in would use a page object representing the login page.
    The test would call methods like loginPage.enterUsername("user") and loginPage.enterPassword("pass")
    without needing to know how these methods locate and interact with the username and password fields on the web page.
    Summary
    The Page Object Model applies object-oriented principles to test automation
    by treating web pages as objects (page objects).
    This approach encapsulates the UI interactions,
    promotes reusability and maintainability,
    and separates the UI logic from the test logic.
    In Selenium WebDriver tests, this leads to cleaner, more manageable, and more robust test code.

    /*
     the concepts of Modeling Pages as Objects, Reusability, Abstraction, and Maintainability are
     closely aligned with key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
     Each of these concepts plays a significant role in OOP and contributes to the overall effectiveness a
     nd organization of object-oriented software development. Let's look at each one:

    1. Modeling Pages as Objects (Object-Based Representation)
    OOP Principle: In OOP, the world is modeled using objects that represent real-world or conceptual entities.
    Each object encapsulates data and behavior.
    Application in POM: In the Page Object Model, each web page is modeled as an object (a page object),
    encapsulating the elements on the page and the operations that can be performed on those elements.
    2. Reusability
    OOP Principle: Reusability is the practice of designing software components (objects, methods, classes)
    that can be reused in different contexts, reducing duplication and improving efficiency.
    Application in POM: Page objects are designed to be reusable across multiple tests.
    For example, a login page object can be used by different tests that need to perform login operations.
    3. Abstraction
    OOP Principle: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing
    only the necessary and relevant functionalities to the user. It simplifies the interface that
    the rest of the application uses.
    Application in POM: Page objects abstract the complexities of UI interactions.
    Tests interacting with a page object do not need to know the specifics of how elements are located and manipulated.
    4. Maintainability
    OOP Principle: Maintainability is the ease with which a software system can be modified to correct defects,
    improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment. Good design and clear structure enhance maintainability.
    Application in POM: Changes in the UI of a web application only require updates
    to the corresponding page objects, not to all the tests that use them.
    This makes maintaining and updating test scripts more manageable.
    Summary
    These OOP principles –
    modeling real-world entities as objects,
    ensuring reusability of components,
    abstracting complexity,
    and focusing on maintainability –
    are integral to the design and implementation of the Page Object Model in test automation.
    POM leverages these principles to create a more structured, efficient,
    and robust approach to writing automated tests, particularly in the context of web applications
    and Selenium WebDriver.

    /*
    If you're asked about the principles of the Page Object Model (POM) in the context of
    software testing and test automation, especially with tools like Selenium WebDriver,
    you can focus on the following key principles:

    1. Encapsulation
    Description: Encapsulation in POM involves bundling the elements and interactions of a particular web page
    within a single page object. This means that the internal workings of the page (like locating elements
    and interacting with them) are hidden from the rest of the application.
    Benefit: By encapsulating page details, changes to the UI can be managed in one place,
    reducing the impact on the test scripts that use these page objects.
    2. Abstraction
    Description: POM abstracts the complexity of interactions with the page. Test scripts interact
    with page objects through high-level methods, without needing to know the underlying details of the UI elements.
    Benefit: This makes test scripts more readable and maintainable,
    and reduces the need for test script changes if the UI changes.
    3. Reusability
    Description: Page objects are designed to be reusable across multiple test cases or scenarios.
    A single page object can be used wherever a particular page or component needs to be tested.
    Benefit: This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to write and maintain test scripts.
    4. Maintainability
    Description: POM enhances maintainability by localizing changes to the UI in the page objects.
    When the UI changes, only the corresponding page object needs to be updated.
    Benefit: Tests become more adaptable to UI changes, reducing the overall maintenance burden.
    5. Separation of Concerns
    Description: POM separates the test logic (what needs to be tested and verification steps)
    from the page interaction logic (how to interact with the page).
    Benefit: This separation makes the test scripts cleaner and focused on the testing logic,
    while the interaction with the application's UI is handled separately.
    6. Readability
    Description: By using meaningful method names in page objects that reflect user actions or intentions,
    POM enhances the readability of test scripts.
    Benefit: Tests become easier to understand and can often be read like a description of the steps
    a user would take, which is beneficial for both testers and non-technical stakeholders.
    Summary
    The principles of the Page Object Model focus on creating a robust, maintainable,
    and efficient framework for automated testing. POM achieves this by encapsulating
    and abstracting page interactions, promoting reusability and readability of code,
    and ensuring a clear separation between the test logic and the page interaction logic.

    /*
    If you're asking about the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in general,
    not specifically in the context of the Page Object Model or test automation, here they are:

    1. Encapsulation
    Description: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (variables) and methods
    that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.
    It also includes restricting direct access to some of the object's components,
    which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.
    Benefit: This principle helps in protecting the internal state of the object and improves modularity.
    2. Abstraction
    Description: Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details
    and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.
    Benefit: It allows focusing on what the object does instead of how it does it,
    making the code more readable and maintainable.
    3. Inheritance
    Description: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class.
    The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and methods of the existing class, known as a superclass.
    Benefit: It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes.
    4. Polymorphism
    Description: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
    It can also refer to the same method working in different ways for different classes.
    Benefit: This principle enhances flexibility and provides a way to use a class exactly
    like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types.
    Summary
    These four principles are foundational to OOP and guide the design
    and structure of object-oriented systems.

    They help in creating software that is modular,
    easy to maintain, and scalable, with a focus on reusing existing code.
