    /*
    The term "vanilla" in the context of software development,
    including in the realm of test automation and Selenium WebDriver, refers to using a technology in its most basic,
    unmodified form.
    This implies that no additional frameworks, libraries, or custom abstractions are built on top of the base technology.
    In your book's context, "vanilla Selenium WebDriver" would mean using Selenium WebDriver as it is,
    without any extra layers or enhancements.

    Here's a bit more detail on the term:

    Original Form: "Vanilla" indicates that the technology is being used as originally designed and distributed,
    without any modifications or extensions.

    Simplicity and Transparency: Using a tool in its "vanilla" form often means the implementation is
    more straightforward and easier to understand, as it lacks the complexity that can come with
    additional layers or customizations.

    No Frameworks or Libraries: In the case of Selenium WebDriver, using it "vanilla" would mean
    not incorporating it into a larger framework or using additional libraries that might abstract some of
    its functionality or add new features.

    Standard Usage: It typically indicates a more general and widely applicable use of the technology,
    adhering to common practices and standard methods of implementation.

    In your ebook, when it refers to "vanilla Selenium WebDriver," it's likely emphasizing the use of Selenium
    in its most basic and direct form. This is often done for educational purposes, to teach the core concepts
    without the added complexity of frameworks or custom libraries.

    /*
    the example you provided is a good illustration of a "vanilla" Selenium WebDriver test.
    It uses the standard Selenium WebDriver API without any additional libraries, frameworks, or custom abstractions.
    The characteristics of this test that make it "vanilla" include:

    Direct Use of Selenium WebDriver API: The test directly interacts with web elements
    using the basic Selenium WebDriver commands like get, findElement, sendKeys, and click.

    No Advanced Frameworks or Libraries: It doesn't use any additional testing frameworks or
    libraries that abstract or extend the basic functionality of Selenium WebDriver.

    Straightforward and Basic Approach: The test is straightforward, following a simple sequence of actions:
    navigating to a URL, interacting with web elements (input fields and a button), and asserting a condition.

    Focus on Core Selenium Functions: The test focuses solely on the core functionalities provided by Selenium WebDriver,
    such as locating elements, interacting with them, and checking conditions.

    This approach is typically used in educational contexts or when introducing the basic concepts of Selenium WebDriver.
    It helps to understand how Selenium interacts with web pages at a fundamental level before moving on
    to more complex scenarios or incorporating additional tools and frameworks.

    /*
    In the test automation world, particularly when discussing Selenium WebDriver and other tools,
    "vanilla" is a term often used to describe the basic, unmodified use of a technology.
    You can use this term in various ways in a sentence, depending on the context. Here are some common usages:

    "A vanilla test/test case": This is a concise way to refer to a test case that uses Selenium WebDriver
    (or any other tool) in its most basic form, without additional frameworks or customizations. For example,
    "We first wrote a vanilla test case to ensure basic functionality."

    "Vanilla Selenium WebDriver": This phrase is used when you want to emphasize the tool itself being used in its original,
    unadulterated form. For instance, "Our examples are based on vanilla Selenium WebDriver
    to demonstrate fundamental concepts."

    "Using vanilla [tool]": This phrase emphasizes the method or approach.
    For example, "In our initial tests, we are using vanilla Selenium WebDriver."

    "A test implemented in vanilla [style]": This variation can be used to indicate the style
    or approach of the implementation. For example, "This test is implemented in vanilla style to avoid complexities."

    "Vanilla implementation of [tool]": This is another way to refer to the straightforward use of a tool.
    For example, "The vanilla implementation of Selenium WebDriver is often best for beginners."

    In conversation or writing, the choice between these phrases typically depends on what aspect
    you want to emphasize: whether it's the test case itself, the tool (like Selenium WebDriver),
    or the style/approach of implementation. All these phrases are commonly understood in the software
    and test automation community.
