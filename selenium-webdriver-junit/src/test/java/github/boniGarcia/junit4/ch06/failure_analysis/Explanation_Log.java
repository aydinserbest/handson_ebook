    Overview of Logging in FailureManager
    The FailureManager class includes a logging mechanism to record important information or errors
    that occur during its operation.
    This is particularly useful for debugging and maintaining the code.

    Logger Initialization
    Logger Declaration:
    static final Logger log = getLogger(lookup().lookupClass());
    This line initializes a Logger object named log. This object is used to log messages.
    Logger Retrieval:
    getLogger(lookup().lookupClass()): This is a method call that retrieves a logger instance
    for the current class (FailureManager). The lookup().lookupClass() part dynamically fetches the class name,
    ensuring that the logger is specific to FailureManager.
    Usage in takePngScreenshot Method
    Try-Catch Block for Exception Handling:
    The file operation (moving the screenshot file to the desired location) is enclosed within a try-catch block.
    This is to catch any IOExceptions that might occur during the file operation.
    Logging the Exception:
    In the catch block, the code logs the exception using the logger.
    log.error("Exception moving screenshot from {} to {}", screenshot, destination, e);:
    This line logs an error message along with the exception details.
    The placeholders {} are replaced by the values of screenshot and destination.
    This provides context about the error, such as which file was being moved and where it was supposed to go.
    The exception e is passed as the last argument,
    allowing the logging framework to record the stack trace.
    This is crucial for diagnosing the root cause of the error.
    Summary
    The logging mechanism in FailureManager is an essential part of the class,
    providing insights into the execution flow and errors. By logging exceptions,
    developers can quickly identify and troubleshoot issues, especially those related to file operations.
    This makes the code more maintainable and easier to debug.
    The use of a dynamic logger ensures that the logs are correctly attributed to the FailureManager class,
    making it clear where the logged events are originating from.

    /*
    The line from the FailureManager class:

    log.error("Exception moving screenshot from {} to {}", screenshot, destination, e);

    This line is a logging statement that is executed in the event of an IOException
    during the screenshot file movement process. Let's break down when and how it works,
    and what happens when this line is executed:

    When and How It Works
    Trigger Condition: This line is executed
    when an IOException is caught in the catch block of the try-catch statement
    surrounding the Files.move operation. An IOException might occur due to various reasons,
    such as file permissions issues, the file being in use, disk space limitations,
    or other file system-related problems.
    Execution Flow:
    When an IOException is caught, the control flow enters the catch block.
    Inside the catch block, this logging statement is executed.
    What Happens During Execution
    Logging the Error:
    The logger's error method is called, which logs an error-level message.
    Error-level logging is typically used to log serious problems,
    especially those that might cause a program to abort.
    Message Formatting:
    The message "Exception moving screenshot from {} to {}" includes placeholders {}.
    These are replaced by the values of screenshot (the original location of the screenshot file)
    and destination (where the file was meant to be moved).
    This formatted message provides a clear and concise description of what operation failed and with which files.
    Exception Logging:
    The exception e is passed as an argument to the error method.
    This allows the logging framework to include the stack trace of the exception in the log output.
    Including the stack trace is crucial for understanding the exact cause and location of the error in the code.
    Output and Visibility
    Log Output:
    The output of this log statement depends on the configuration of the logging framework
    (like Logback, Log4J, etc.).
    The configuration determines where the log messages are written (e.g., console, file, log management system).
    Visibility:
    If the logger is configured to output to the console, you would see the error message
    and stack trace in the console output.
    If it's configured to write to a file or another logging destination,
    you'd need to check that destination to see the output.
    Summary
    The logging statement is a crucial part of error handling,
    providing visibility into what went wrong during the execution of the takePngScreenshot method.
    When an exception occurs, this line logs a detailed error message along with the stack trace,
    which is invaluable for debugging and resolving issues effectively.
    The actual visibility of this log depends on the logger's configuration.
